# Phishing Email Simulator 🔐

A Final-Year Cybersecurity Project designed to simulate phishing email campaigns in a controlled and ethical environment. The system helps evaluate user awareness, track phishing link interactions, and improve security training within organizations.

## 📌 Project Overview

Phishing remains one of the most effective social engineering attacks due to human vulnerability. This project demonstrates how simulated phishing campaigns can be used as a cybersecurity awareness tool.

The system safely generates phishing-style emails, tracks user clicks through a Flask backend, stores results in an SQLite database, and displays analytics in an admin dashboard. All emails are tested using Mailtrap’s sandbox environment to ensure ethical compliance.
